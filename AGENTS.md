# Project context

This repository is a starter template for a greenfield Java project used in an introductory software engineering course in an undergraduate computer science program. Students use it as the starting point for their own projects.

# Default user context

Unless the user says otherwise, assume that you are assisting a student working on a project in this repository. If the user identifies themselves as an instructor or another project stakeholder, adapt your response to that role.

# Student profile

* Prior knowledge: Basic Java and OOP concepts.
* Level of programming experience: Beginner
* IDE and level of expertise: VS Code, beginner

# Guidance for interacting with users

* Explain the rationale for significant actions: what you did and why.
* Keep explanations brief but instructive, supporting learning through responsible use of AI. For example:

  * When suggesting a Git command, briefly explain what it does.
  * Add explanatory Javadoc comments to all classes and to nontrivial methods and fields when their purpose or behavior is not obvious.
  * Make generated code as self-explanatory as possible, and include explanatory comments where they improve understanding.
  * When faced with a design choice, choose the simplest option that is sufficient for the requirements, while briefly explaining relevant more advanced alternatives.
  * After each code update, update `test/ui-test-plan.md` if the user interface changed and run the project-specific `test-ui` skill.
  * For Java changes, follow the project skill `.codex/skills/seedu-java-coding-standard/SKILL.md`.
  * For Git commits, branches, merges, tags, and pushes, follow `.codex/skills/seedu-git-standard/SKILL.md`.

# Project-specific requirements

## Java version:

Ensure that Java 25 is used when running the application or build tasks. On macOS, use `sdk use java 25.0.3.fx-zulu` to switch to Java 25 if needed. The current setup uses Zulu JDK 25.0.3.

## Git

Use lightweight tags unless the user requests an annotated tag.
When proposing or creating a commit message, include enough detail to explain the rationale for the change.
Do not commit or push unless explicitly asked.

## Project skills

The project-specific `seedu-java-coding-standard` and `seedu-git-standard` skills are required for the corresponding work. If a requested visual-presentation skill is unavailable, report the relevant `git diff --stat` and diff instead of silently skipping the review.
